description="

Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated 
context-free grammar into a deterministic LR or generalized LR (GLR) 
parser employing LALR(1) parser tables. As an experimental feature, 
Bison can also generate IELR(1) or canonical LR(1) parser tables. Once 
you are proficient with Bison, you can use it to develop a wide range 
of language parsers, from those used in simple desk calculators to 
complex programming languages.
