description="


The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point 
computations with correct rounding. MPFR has continuously been supported 
by the INRIA and the current main authors come from the Caramba and 
AriC project-teams at Loria (Nancy, France) and LIP (Lyon, France) 
respectively; see more on the credit page. MPFR is based on the GMP 
multiple-precision library.

The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision 
floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a 
well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 
standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic 
(53-bit significand).
