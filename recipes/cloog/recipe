description="

CLooG is a software which generates loops for scanning Z-polyhedra. That is,
CLooG finds the code or pseudo-code where each integral point of one or more
parametrized polyhedron or parametrized polyhedra union is reached. CLooG is
designed to avoid control overhead and to produce a very efficient code.

Its input is some data on the polyhedra to scan, basically the system of
affine inequalities that define them, and a context that defines some
properties known on the parameters if any. The output is the pseudo scanning
code. Many facilities are provided to generate a near-to-be-compileable code,
and every useful functions to generate the code may be called from the CLooG
library.
