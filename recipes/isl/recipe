description="

isl is a library for manipulating sets and relations of integer points 
bounded by linear constraints. Supported operations on sets include 
intersection, union, set difference, emptiness check, convex hull, 
(integer) affine hull, integer projection, and computing the 
lexicographic minimum using parametric integer programming. It also 
includes an ILP solver based on generalized basis reduction and 
operations geared towards polyhedral compilation such as dependence 
analysis, scheduling, and AST generation.
